to githubâ€™s API concurrently to get users info.

* Make
* The dependencies are listed in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml).

```

### Starting the service

In order to start the server, you should set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your
personal access token. 

Checkout [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) on how to create your personal access token.
